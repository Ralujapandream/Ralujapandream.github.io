Japanese calligraphy, or _shodō_ (書道), is a practice that brings me immense joy and peace. It’s not just about creating beautiful characters—it’s a way to express myself and connect with a rich cultural tradition.

Here are two examples of my recent works:

Through calligraphy, I find tranquility and a creative outlet that enriches my life. I hope you enjoy these glimpses into my passion!
