subtitle: Who is Raluca Dumitrescu?
---

My name is Raluca Dumitrescu, and I live in Romania. I’m deeply passionate about restoration work, where I dedicate my time and skills to bringing timeless pieces back to life.

When I’m not working, you’ll often find me immersed in my hobby: Japanese calligraphy. This art form inspires me with its elegance, precision, and deep cultural heritage. It’s a practice that brings both creativity and tranquility into my life.

### My Story

My journey has been a blend of professional dedication and personal discovery. Through restoration, I’ve learned the value of patience and precision, and through calligraphy, I’ve come to appreciate the beauty of expression and form. Together, they shape who I am and guide my path.
